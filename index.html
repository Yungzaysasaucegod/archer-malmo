	In the above picture, an Archer Malmo employee, Gabe, speaks for what seems like forever about the company. He describes some of the basic processes of him and his colleague's work. He answers our questions and enlightens us on his world of coding.

	Above is the main lobby of the Archer Malmo building. All packages and clients come to this floor. This was an interesting area. In the room, was a crate filled with different trophies. One of them looked like a ping pong trophy. They sure do love ping pong.

	After our trip to Archer Malmo, we had tasty lunch at Cook Out. Cookout was founded in 1989 in Greensboro, North Carolina. I ordered a double burger, french fries, onion rings, and a Dr. Pepper. I ate it all and did not leave dissapointed.
